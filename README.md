# Scope Of Repo
This is a repository for my first run on learning Godot.
I'm getting the basics down of Godot, coming from roblox, so its a bit of a transition.
I'll be making features/mock-ups for the things I want in my project I have in mind in here as practice, so its kind of a sandbox and isnt at the same time.
> We'll see how it goes 😎

# Feature List
Here is a list of features/mechanics I want to make a prototype out of before production and networking:
* Breakable resources (stone or a tree)
  * You punch or mine the resource to harvest it
* Inventory Features
  * UI
  * Stacks for items, rather than one tile with a bunch of items
* Leveling
  * Experience system (gain xp by stuff like pve, harvesting, crafting)
  * Experience grants points to upgrade player
* Player Stats
  * Create stats for players
  > Will effect how certian interactions are done (more/less effectively)
* NPC System
  * Create basic npc interaction (inventory)
  * npc health, stam, ext
  * npc mounting (for creatures)
* PVP Systems
  * Create punch mechanic
  * Create weapons to be used in combat (guns, knives, ext)
* Building
  * Structure placing mechanic/snap grid (*Most important of the catagory*)
  * Defense structures (turrets, ext)
